# CHANGELOG

## 0.0.2 - 2026-03-06
### Added
- Commander mode fixture store (`FixtureStoreService`) using Angular signals, keyed by unique `fixture_name`.
- Commander sidebar listing fixtures grouped by `plan_name` and sorted by `plan_name` + `fixture_name`.
- Fixture selection modal (read-only JSON) that opens from sidebar selection and auto-fills fixture query input.

### Changed
- Commander page layout converted to two-column design (left fixture list, right query/health panels).
- Commander endpoint result ingestion now upserts fixture data into runtime store from both fixture and plan queries.
- Top mode tab active styling improved for clearer `Direct` vs `Commander` context.
- Commander in-page `h2` title removed to reduce duplicate page labeling.
- App patch version bumped to `0.0.2`.

### Fixed
- Commander error rendering now surfaces backend HTTP detail payloads (including `step` and `output_tail`) instead of generic unknown errors.

### Verified
- `npm run build` succeeds after store/sidebar/modal and UI updates.

## 0.0.1 - 2026-03-06
### Changed
- Upgraded Angular from 20.3.x to 21.2.1 (`@angular/core`, `@angular/cli`, and related framework/build packages).
- Applied Angular update migrations:
  - Updated bootstrap configuration in `src/main.ts`.
  - Updated TypeScript app config in `tsconfig.app.json`.
  - Updated Angular workspace config in `angular.json`.

### Verified
- `npm run build` succeeds after the upgrade.
